## Overview

This is a newbie challenge on the frontend Mentor challenge, where you are given a design of a "blog preview card", and you are to create a duplicate or a close match to it. A downloadable folder is given where you have the resources to the favicon, and the pictures depicted in the design.

### The challenge

The challenge here was to;

- Create a duplicate using any tools of your choice, using HTML and CSS.

- Create the hovering effects on selected elements.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [http://127.0.0.1:5500/blog-preview-card-frontend-mentor/]

## My process

- The first thing I did was to draw the outline of the image, stating the exact places I would keep divs.

- I then downloaded the Figma files that came with the challenge, to make it much easier to check the paddings, and correct sizes. Just to make my life a little bit easier.

- Whenever I got stuck, I just googled my problem and there was always a solution on sites like "stackoverflow" and "w3schools".

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- Figma

### What I learned

- I learnt how to put an image and text in line using the flexbox to center them together

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
#avatar-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I would study and focus more on paddings and margins, and also learn more about flexbox as well. I did not make a perfect prototype, but I must say I am quite proud of myself with this particular challenge. I have learnt a lot from doing this challenge and will be hoping to carry the next knowledge learnt here unto something more challenging.

### Useful resources

- [(https://www.w3schools.com/)] - This helped me with documentation with the little things I had forgotten in my studies.
